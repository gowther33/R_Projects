## Data Wrangling
#Since we are interested in characteristics of a viral video, 
#letâ€™s engineer some new features related to likes, comments, and 
#views.

# LikesPer1k: number of likes per 1000 views
# CommentsPer1k: number of comments per 1000 views
# TitleLen: number of characters in the title

video_stats <- video_stats %>%
  mutate(LikesPer1k = round(Likes/(Views/1000), 2),
         CommentsPer1k = round(Comments/(Views/1000), 2),
         TitleLen = nchar(Title))

# Adding Publication yearcolumn
video_stats <- video_stats %>%
  mutate(PubYear = as.factor(substr(Published.At,1,4)),
         Published.At = as.POSIXct(Published.At, format="%Y-%m-%d"))


## Static plots

# Bar Chart
video_stats %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=PubYear)) +
  geom_bar(fill="#765add") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Number of videos by year", x = "Publication Year", y = "Count")

# Histogram of title length
video_stats %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=TitleLen)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="#765add", bins=30) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of title length", x = "Title Length (char)", y = "Frequency")

## Interactive plots

# Line Chart
plot1 <- video_stats %>%
  # get the total comments per keyword per year; divide by 1000 to change scale
  group_by(PubYear, Keyword) %>%
  summarize(total_comments = sum(Comments)/1000) %>%
  # ggplot colored by keywords
  ggplot(aes(x=PubYear, y=total_comments, color=Keyword))+
  # group = 1 specifies we want 1 line per keyword
  geom_line(aes(group=1)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5,alpha=0.5) +
  ylab("Comment Count") +
  xlab("Published Year") +
  labs(title="Total Comments by Category Overtime (by 1k)")+
  theme_minimal()
# convert it into a plotly graph
ggplotly(plot1)


# Checking for trend of creating shorter titles for all content overtime.
plot2 <- video_stats %>%
  # average title length per keyword per year
  group_by(PubYear, Keyword) %>%
  summarize(avg_len = mean(TitleLen)) %>%
  # ggplot colored by keywords
  ggplot(aes(x=PubYear, y=avg_len, color=Keyword))+
  geom_line(aes(group=1)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5,alpha=0.5) +
  ylab("Avg Title Length (char)") +
  xlab("Published Year") +
  labs(title="Avg Title Length by Category Overtime (by 1k)")+
  theme_minimal()
# converting into a plotly graph
ggplotly(plot2)
